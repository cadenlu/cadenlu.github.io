      <description>I had Costco Mesquite Wings for the first time today. It is around the same price of the raw wings and drumsticks, but it is already cooked and seasoned. It was yummy after reheating it up in the oven.&#xA;I thought it tasted like pizza&#xA;My dad thought it tasted like Indian-Mexican food&#xA;My mom thought it tasted like Chipotle chicken&#xA;My cousin thought it tasted like BBQ flavour&#xA;I think it is a good deal for the price.</description>

      <description>All my personal projects can be reduced to Todo List.&#xA;Bus Optimizer? Todo List with math and maps.&#xA;Bug Tracker? Todo List with comments and auth.&#xA;PCPartPicker clone? Todo List with a price database and web scraper.&#xA;Even this blog is functionally a Todo List of posts.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a Todo List developer forever.</description>

      <description>Walking Robot Simulation def robotSim(self, commands: List[int], obstacles: List[List[int]]) -&amp;gt; int: # for O(1) lookup in obstacles obstacles = set(map(tuple, obstacles)) direction = 0 # O123 is NESW move = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)] max_distance = 0 curr = [0,0] for command in commands: if command &amp;gt; 0: # move in direction while command &amp;gt; 0 and (curr[0]+move[direction][0], curr[1]+move[direction][1]) not in obstacles: curr[0] += move[direction][0] curr[1] += move[direction][1] command -= 1 elif command == -1: # right direction = (direction + 1) % 4 elif command == -2: # left direction = (direction + 3) % 4 max_distance = max(max_distance, curr[0]*curr[0] + curr[1]*curr[1]) return max_distance Was getting TLE the first time since I used obstacles as is for lookups, pretty straightforward otherwise.</description>
