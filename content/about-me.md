Hi I am Caden and I like bread.

I am currently working as web man for UBC Web Services. I love to code and learn new things. I am passionate about technology and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

I am currently working on a few side projects and I am always looking for new ideas to work on. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to chat and help out in any way I can.
