I had Costco Mesquite Wings for the first time today. It is around the same price of the raw wings and drumsticks, but it is already cooked and seasoned.
It was yummy after reheating it up in the oven.

I thought it tasted like pizza

My dad thought it tasted like Indian-Mexican food

My mom thought it tasted like Chipotle chicken

My cousin thought it tasted like BBQ flavour

I think it is a good deal for the price. I would recommend trying it out if you like chicken and want an alternative to the regular Costco chicken.
